# AlisaTodorova-SinglyLinkedList

I received the following coding task (about singly linked list) during an interview:

## Task
Develop a desktop application on Windows or Linux that implements a singly linked list of integers (user-entered) and returns the value of the Mth (user-entered) element from the end of the list such that when M = 0 the last element of the list is returned. Make sure you devise a time- and space-efficient algorithm that only uses the head of the list and M as input where the length of the list is unknown and take care to handle relevant error conditions.

Note:
You are not allowed to use the perks of the language you use such as predefined (linked list) data structures or algorithms.

Example:
1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 and M = 0 must return the value of 5 (the value of the last element).

1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 and M = 1 must return the value of 2 (the value of the element before the last).

## Running my solution
You can run my program from the main method in Main.java class. 

You can find all the methods and algorithms I created in Node.java class.
